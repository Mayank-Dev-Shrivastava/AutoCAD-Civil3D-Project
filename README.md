# AutoCAD-Civil3D-Project

    Point Import: Imported a set of geospatial points from a CSV file, sourced from Udemy, for further analysis and design.
    
    Surface Generation: Generated a topographic surface representation from the imported points to establish the existing ground conditions.
    
    Alignment and Offset Creation: Created an alignment, incorporating offsets as necessary, to define the path and geometry of the road or pathway.
    
    Existing Ground Profile Development: Developed an existing ground profile along the alignment, which represents the elevation changes along the proposed route in relation to the original terrain. Along with the existing ground profile a design profile is also added.
    
    Profile Banding: Established bands to determine parameters like existing elevation, design elevation, also cut and fill depth at a particular cross-section.
    
    Assembly Design: Designed road assemblies that encompass different road layers, including pavement layers (e.g., Pave1, Pave2, base, subbase), as well as added elements like curbs and daylights.

    Cross-Section Generation: Created road cross-sections perpendicular to the alignment, providing a detailed view of the road design at various locations along its length.

    Material Table Integration: Implemented a material table that quantifies the volumes of material to be excavated or added (cut or fill) at each cross-section, aiding in construction planning and cost estimation.
